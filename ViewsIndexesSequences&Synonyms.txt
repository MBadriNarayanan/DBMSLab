Note : Use the tables created for Joins,SubQueries & SetOperators

1) Create a view jview from journey table such that it contains day, time and route id with j_day, j_time and j_rid as column headings.

SQL> create view jview(j_day,j_time,j_rid) as select doj,time,rid from journey ;

View created.


2) Update the jview such that j_day is 20-jan-2018 and j_rid is 301.

SQL> update jview set j_date = '20-JAN-18' where j_rid = 301 ;

0 rows updated.


3) Select the contents of the corresponding table that jview is based and check whether the update has occurred.

SQL> select doj,time,rid from journey ;

DOJ           TIME        RID
----          ----        ---
29-AUG-19     5:00        1
05-JAN-19     14:00       2
14-FEB-19     10:00       3
10-MAR-19     22:00       4

4 rows selected.


4) Create a synonym passenger for ticket_detail table.

SQL> create synonym passenger for ticket_detail ;

Synonym created.


5) Display the contents of passenger.

SQL> select * from passenger ;

TNO     NAME      S     AGE     FARE
----    -----     --    ---     ----
1       Haley     F     18      850
2       Phil      M     45      600
3       John      M     19      650
4       Dylan     M     21      400

4 rows selected.


6) Create a synonym bus details for busroute1 table.

SQL> create synonym route_detail for bus_route ;

Synonym created.


7) Drop the passenger synonym created previously.

SQL> drop synonym passenger ;

Synonym dropped.


8) Create an index on route_id column on busroute table.

SQL> create index dis_index on bus_route(dis) ;

Index created.


9) Drop the index what you had created.

SQL> drop index dis_index ;

Index dropped.


10) Create a sequence ticket where minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 20 and increment it with 2 starting with 1.

SQL> create sequence ticseq minvalue 1 maxvalue 20 increment by 2 start with 1 ;

Sequence created.


11) Insert the sequence ticket into the ticket column of ticket table.

SQL> alter table ticket(t_seq number) ;

Table altered.

SQL> update ticket set t_seq = ticseq.nextval ;

4 rows updated.


12) Alter the sequence such that the maximum value is 25.

SQL> alter sequence ticseq maxvalue 25 ;

Sequence altered ;

13) List all the sequences created by you.

SQL> select sequence_name from user_sequences ;

SEQUENCE_NAME
------------
TICSEQ


14) List all the views created by you.

SQL> selec view_name from user_views ;

VIEW_NAME
--------
JVIEW

15) List all the indexes created by you.

SQL> select index_name from user_indexes ;

INDEX_NAME
---------
SYS_C005423
SYS_C005424
SYS_C005425
SYS_C005429



16) Drop all the database objects created by you.

SQL> drop sequence ticseq ;

SQL> drop view jview ;

View dropped.

SQL> drop table busdetails ;
